# Zomato Dataset Cleaning with SQL

This project demonstrates how I cleaned and prepared the Zomato restaurant dataset using advanced SQL techniques. The goal was to transform raw, inconsistent data into a reliable foundation for analysis and dashboard creation.

# Project Overview

- **Dataset**: Zomato restaurant data (CSV format)
- **Tools Used**: SQL (PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server)

 # Focus Areas:
  - Data cleaning and transformation
  - Handling missing and inconsistent values
  - Aggregation and KPI generation
 

# What This Project Covers

# Data Cleaning
- Removed duplicates and nulls
- Standardized categorical fields (`Has_Online_delivery`, `Has_Table_booking`, etc.)
- Converted flags to binary indicators
- Grouped and aggregated data for analysis

# Business Challenges Solved
- City-wise restaurant distribution and delivery penetration
- Cuisine popularity and rating classification
- Price range vs cost correlation
- KPI dashboards for cities and delivery status
- Advanced filtering, ranking, and percentage calculations

# Advanced SQL Techniques
- `CASE` statements for classification
- `GROUP BY` with `HAVING` filters
- `ROW_NUMBER()` for ranking
- `WINDOW FUNCTIONS` for percentage calculations
- Subqueries for comparative analysis
